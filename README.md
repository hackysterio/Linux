<h1>Linux Commands</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this repository, I'm delighted to exhibit the practical expertise I've gained from thoroughly studying the "Linux Basics for Hackers" book. Having completed the book a while ago, I'm excited to showcase the Linux commands and skills I've acquired. This project serves as a testament to my hands-on experience with Linux concepts covered in the book. While I haven't covered every exercise, I've focused on presenting the commands and techniques that have significantly contributed to my understanding of Linux. Feel free to explore this collection of practical demonstrations and implementations. Your insights and input are invaluable as I continue to refine and expand my Linux capabilities. Thank you for joining me in this journey of skill growth and practical application!

<h2>Linux Commands walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
<br />
The pwd command stands for "print working directory." When you use this command in a terminal, it displays the absolute path of the current directory you are in. This helps you understand where you are located within the file system. In this case, I'm in the root directory:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
The cd command stands for "change directory." It allows you to navigate through the file system by moving from one directory to another. To move up one level in the directory hierarchy, you can use "cd .." This command takes you from your current directory to a directory above. For instance, if you were in the "/root" directory and you used "cd ..", you would be taken to the "/" directory. The "/" directory is the parent (i.e. the origin) directory of the entire file system.: <br/>

<br />
<br />
The ls command stands for "list." It is used to display the contents of a directory, allowing you to see the contents within it. For example, if you were in the "/" directory and you run ls, it would list the names of all the files and directories present in the root directory:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
The whoami command is used to determine the current user's username. When you run the whoami command, it displays the username associated with the account you are currently logged in as:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
The cat command, short for "concatenate," is used to display the contents of a file in the terminal. It's particularly useful for quickly viewing the content of <b>text files</b>:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
You can use the cat command to create a new file and populate it with text. For example "cat>demo" will create a new demo file, after this you can start typing the contents you want in the demo file. When you're done with this, you can press Ctrl + D :  <br/>

<br />
<br />
You can also use the cat command to add text to an existing file. For instance, to append more text to the "demo" file, you use the command "cat>>demo". Similarly, you should press Ctrl + D when you're done:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
The mkdir command stands for "make directory." It is used to create new directories. You can specify the name of the directory you want to create as an argument after the mkdir command. For example, to create a directory named "hackysterio," you would use:  <br/>
